There are two types of OS command injection attacks: normal OS command injection and blind OS command injection attacks.

Normal OS command injection attack: the output of the command is visible in the HTTP response.
Blind OS command injection attack: the output of the command is not visible in the HTTP reponse.

Many attacks can be performed using blind OS command injections.
