As the name suggests, an OS command injection attack allows an attacker to execute operating system commands on a compromised server. 
These commands can be either Linux or Windows-based, though most servers are Linux-based.


Some examples of commands on a compromised server can be:

whoami
uname -a
ls -la /home/user
cat /etc/passwd
pwd

And so on ...
